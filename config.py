# === PROMPTS ===

author_promt = """Here's the raw prompt as a plain English string with text-based numbering:

I will send you a BIO text from a Telegram channel. Your task is to extract the username of the person or group most likely to be the channel's author or creator.

The username may appear in the following formats:
1) @username (e.g. @asynco)
2) username.t.me
3) https://t.me/username

Guidelines:
– First, prefer usernames labeled as: creator, author, admin, owner, founder, создатель, основатель, админ, владелец, etc.
– Second, ignore usernames clearly marked for support, bots, ads, managers, or unrelated projects.
– Third, if no label is present, choose the most likely author based on context, wording, or position in the text.
– Fourth, even if there are multiple usernames, return the one that is most likely to be the channel owner.
– Fifth, if all usernames clearly belong to non-owners (e.g. support bots or ad contacts), return: {"author": null}

Return the result as a plain JSON string with no formatting or extra text.

Examples:
{"author": "asynco"}
{"author": null}
